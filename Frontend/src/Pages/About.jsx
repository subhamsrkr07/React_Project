          Founded in 2025, InfluencerConnect started as a small initiative to
          help local brands collaborate with social media creators. Over time,
          we expanded globally, partnering with thousands of influencers across
          niches like fashion, tech, travel, and more. Our journey has been
          fueled by the belief that authentic marketing can change the way
          brands connect with people.
